# DuckDuckGo Langauge Phrase Generator


While contributing my "Bulgarian Phrases Cheatsheet" to DDG
I realised that this could be partially if not fully automated.

I simply scrape the [Linguanaut](http://www.linguanaut.com) website and
 and generate the JSON object for the cheetsheat.

There is still some work to do but I'm currenlty in Java mode.
